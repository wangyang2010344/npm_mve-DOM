# mve-DOM

## Description
a simple dom birdge for mve

## Software Architecture
pure TypeScript

## peculiarity

* Process (functional) genes, earlier than react. The author avoids using concepts such as class/this in ts/js.
* No component concept, full use of the programming language itself module (function) reuse.
* The base model is only mve. Value\<T\> and mve. ArrayModel\<T\> builds a huge page logic.
* The interface layout uses pure ts/js, does not introduce complex xml, and is reused more efficiently.
* mvvm targeted updates to property nodes (inspired by vue) with high performance. And innovatively discover the use of mve. ArrayModel\<T\> corresponds to the interface fragment one by one (supports peer nesting) and does not use virtual DOM and any form of hedonistic reuse.
* Distinguish core modules that are not related to the DOM engine and can be used for other custom engines. And provides a simple dom bridging module.
* Open to customize your own mve usage.
